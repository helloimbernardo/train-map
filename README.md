## Development
This project has a development branch, named `dev`. For major projects that might take longer, a new branch may be created, although this is rare.  
To get the project running, just clone the repository locally and run the following commands:

**1. obtain a maptiler access token and create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:**
```env 
VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY=your_access_token_here
```
(if you don't have a mapbox access token, you can get one [here](https://maptiler.com/). if you're publishing with github pages you should add the token to the repository action secrets with the same name as the variable above.)

**2. install dependencies**
```bash
# for npm users
npm i
# or for yarn users
yarn
```

**3. run the development server**
```bash
# for npm users
npm dev
# or for yarn users
yarn dev
```
